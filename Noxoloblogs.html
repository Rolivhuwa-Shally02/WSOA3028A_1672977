              <p> <h1>Focusing on your Health, Fitness and Sanity</h1>
                <p>April 15, 2021 by Mphephu NF</p>
                <br>
               <p1>Healthy does not look a certain way, healthy is not a particular body type, healthy looks 
                different on everybody. When you<br> take care of your health it is not just the outside look that
                matters but most importantly youremotional and mental well-being. <br> Physical activities like 
                working out, jogging, hiking, dancing can help improve your physical well-being, improve 
                your<br> emotional health and furthermore it decreases stress, anxiety and also improve your 
                mood and that is a way of dealing<br> with mental health. You must know your body and be 
                conscious of changes that you encounter or feel, know when you<br> are not well and seek help 
                and this either emotionally, physically or mentally. Health also has to do with the food you<br>
                eat, are you eating healthy? Are you drinking water regularly? This kind of lifestyle is open 
                for anyone in other ways it is not<br> expensive lifestyle to stay healthy, watching what you take 
                inside your body is way of looking after your health.</p1> <br>
  <br>
                <p1>Fitness is being physically fit and healthy, It has to do more with muscular strength, being 
                  able to perform certain activities<br> that require the use of strength, doing daily activities and 
                  this can be achieved by proper nutrition, exercise and getting<br> enough rest. There are four 
                  types of fitness that is, flexibility, balance, strength and endurance and being able to work on<br>
                  just one of them promotes your body to be fit. Being fit is another way of taking care of your
                  health, it improves your quality of life,<br> increase energy, boost immune system and it helps 
                  your body to fight diseases or reduce the risk of developing diseases. </p1> <br>
               <br>
               <p1>Health, fitness and sanity all link together, they all have to do with a personâ€™s well-being, 
                sanity is your mental health.To take care of your<br> sanity, you must find what works for you in 
                dealing with your mental health however there are common activities that can help like<br>
                exercising, eating healthy, enjoying doing your hobbies, get busy on activities that release 
                stress, play games, spend time with friends,<br> family or people who give you peace, having 
                peace comes from taking care of your sanity as well. It is important to take care of your<br> 
                sanity, some people find sanity from simple things such as flowers, being close to flowers, 
                watering them and viewing nature itself,<br> photography (capturing moments) also works for 
                some people, staying indoors watching movies,doing work because some people <br> surprisingly
                love working, being on their computer and programming or doing other stuff that keep them 
                busy. </p1> <br>
                <br>
  <p1>When it comes to mental health you find what works for you, pay attention of how you are 
    reasoning especially when going through<br>a lot or overworking and learn to do simple things 
    like getting fresh air, go for a walk and also develop the habit of being positive, if<br> things not
    working out causes you stress, follow the tips above or do what works for you and stay 
    healthy.</p1> <br>

    <p> There are things are do during at my free time for fun, as a routine and for health purposes and these are my hobbies; gym,
      jogging, creating content on my social<br> pages, playing Netball and watching series. There are certain things i have so much interest
    and excitement on like hiking, playing music, cooking nice meals,<br> reading novels, dancing, writing songs and playing my guiter </p>
<br>
    <h3>My life in Johannesburg</h3>
    <br>
    <P> Except that work i on a daily, I mentor accounting students who are under SAICa and i do all this online due to the pandemic
      however i do not stay indoors all day or everyday, <br>I love being around my family so although i currently live in Sandton
      i visit my mother and my siblings most of the times, Protea Glen is also<br> still a place for me i go for some peace and warmth 
     On my free time or weekends, i go out with few friends,<br> it is either i go hiking, there are nice places for that like Rietvlei Zoo Farm beacuse 
     i love hiking, it's part of things i do not just for healthy<br> routine but for fun, Going out to buy clothes or food is what i do most days alone or with friends
     I am currently single and mingling so i love going out to dates,<br> Johannesburg has really nice places i like setting my foot on 
     everytime i dress nice and ready to go on outings. <br> I have currently volunteered at Johannesburg Charlotte Maxeke in physiotherapy, this is a nice experience 
     for me for<br> i get to give back to the community, giving proper excercises to patients and chatting<br> with them for me is very nice, i enjoy 
     the conversation and seeing the good impacts of this
    </P>

    <h1> I will be showing you how to stay healthy, fit and take care of your sanity</h1> 



<br>

     <!-- Take this to Noxolo's blogs-->

     <p> Staying healthy should not be expensive to start with, you do not have to buy expensive food to be
       healthy, you do not have to pay up for gym to workout,<br> I mean i wake in the morning and work out in my room, with no weights but just
      me and my own body with a bottle of water, this is all part <br>of healthy lifestyle and this includes your sanity, having peace of mind, feeling relaxed
    and releasing that tension in your body. Some people prefer meditation<br> and that also works so go to a nice area, clean and environmentally user-friendly
  you can do this with music or no music, sometimes when you are outdoors <br>surrounded by nature, that also helps with relaxation and clearing mind </p>
      <br>
      <h1> Easy daily routine: Drink water on a daily basis</h1> 
      <img src="images/woman-drinking-water-260nw-135130826.jpg" style="width: 20%;" alt="food">
      <br> 
      
    <h1> healthy diet and cheat days</h1>
    <br>
    <p> Do not eat the same meal everday continously, change your diet, Most people are used to the same meal, sometimes we are lazy to make 
      a different meal, sometimes we just donâ€™t have variety<br> of ingredients, well i can relate to all, try to change your meals and not get
    used to the same routines, eating healthy does not mean you nolonger<br> going to eat chocolate or cookies, it is nice to have some snacks once in a while
  but do not make this regularly, sugary and sweet food are nice but if you <br>want be healthy just have those "cheat days". Do not eat 
the same type of fruit many times a day, vary your fruits, for<br> instance if you have two bananas and two apples, take one from each type of fruit</p>
