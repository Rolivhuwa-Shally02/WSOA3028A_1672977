                <p>April 15, 2021 by Mphephu NF</p>
               <p1>Healthy does not look a certain way, healthy is not a particular body type, healthy looks 
                different on everybody. When you<br> take care of your health it is not just the outside look that
                matters but most importantly youremotional and mental well-being. <br> Physical activities like 
                working out, jogging, hiking, dancing can help improve your physical well-being, improve 
                your<br> emotional health and furthermore it decreases stress, anxiety and also improve your 
                mood and that is a way of dealing<br> with mental health. You must know your body and be 
                conscious of changes that you encounter or feel, know when you<br> are not well and seek help 
                and this either emotionally, physically or mentally. Health also has to do with the food you<br>
                eat, are you eating healthy? Are you drinking water regularly? This kind of lifestyle is open 
                for anyone in other ways it is not<br> expensive lifestyle to stay healthy, watching what you take 
                inside your body is way of looking after your health.</p1> <br>
  <br>
                <p1>Fitness is being physically fit and healthy, It has to do more with muscular strength, being 
                  able to perform certain activities<br> that require the use of strength, doing daily activities and 
                  this can be achieved by proper nutrition, exercise and getting<br> enough rest. There are four 
                  types of fitness that is, flexibility, balance, strength and endurance and being able to work on<br>
                  just one of them promotes your body to be fit. Being fit is another way of taking care of your
                  health, it improves your quality of life,<br> increase energy, boost immune system and it helps 
                  your body to fight diseases or reduce the risk of developing diseases. </p1> <br>
               <br>
               <p1>Health, fitness and sanity all link together, they all have to do with a person’s well-being, 
                sanity is your mental health.To take care of your<br> sanity, you must find what works for you in 
                dealing with your mental health however there are common activities that can help like<br>
                exercising, eating healthy, enjoying doing your hobbies, get busy on activities that release 
                stress, play games, spend time with friends,<br> family or people who give you peace, having 
                peace comes from taking care of your sanity as well. It is important to take care of your<br> 
                sanity, some people find sanity from simple things such as flowers, being close to flowers, 
                watering them and viewing nature itself,<br> photography (capturing moments) also works for 
                some people, staying indoors watching movies,doing work because some people <br> surprisingly
                love working, being on their computer and programming or doing other stuff that keep them 
                busy. </p1> <br>
                <br>
  <p1>When it comes to mental health you find what works for you, pay attention of how you are 
    reasoning especially when going through<br>a lot or overworking and learn to do simple things 
    like getting fresh air, go for a walk and also develop the habit of being positive, if<br> things not
    working out causes you stress, follow the tips above or do what works for you and stay 
    healthy.</p1> <br>
