            <p> <h1>       Methods for analysis and critiques of UX and/or UI  </h1>
                <p> April 05, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>For a start it is important to know that UX and UI have to do with design, they work together
                   and in other means they <br>complement each other. UX which stands User Experience is the process
                    of developing and improving<br> quality of interaction between the user and the product. According
                     to Don Norman “UX encompasses all<br> aspects of the end-users’ interaction with the company, its
                      services and products”, therefore <br>it is employed across products, interfaces and services. 
                      It was adopted by the Human-Computer <br>Interaction (HCI), community practitioners and researchers,
                       Ideas represented by UX are important but no means<br> original-Mark Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky. 
                       UX has to do with data, analysis, flows, research, testing,<br> interaction and usability it is about 
                       putting all UI elements together in one product, <br>how to put them together, how you experience or that product or service.  </p1>
                       <br>

               
              <p1>UI stands for User Interface which has to do with the look and feel of the product and it is about visualisation, 
                  using images, colours, videos,<br> typography, spacing, proximity, consistency, etc. It combines Visual Design and 
                  Interaction Design, it makes interfaces <br>beautiful and readable, it makes emotional connections. An example 
                  could be from the technology devices we use on daily<br> basis like phones, laptops, tablets in terms of how we input 
                  data to interact with them, touching on the screen or using keyboard <br>on our laptops. Both UI and UX work together to
                   create user-friendly and aesthetically rich products however UX is done first<br> and then UI follows. 
                   The role of UX design is to work on process and strategy (product structure and analysis,<br> content development, etc.), 
                   Wireframing and prototyping, Execution and Analytics so basically<br> that is what a UX designer focuses on. A UI designer
                    works on the look and feel of the product and responsiveness and interactivity.  </p1><br>

                <p1>Looking at the common methods of UX or UI, we have persona and storytelling, sketch, wireframe and prototype, 
                    User Test and interviews, Usability<br> test and scenario, pattern library and Heuristic analysis however some of
                     these methods were mentioned above<br> as roles of these designs. Methods of analysis of UX and UI in particular
                      are Website and Device Analytics<br> (information about click paths, target demographics and device preferences), 
                      Business and sales analytics (allow companies to measure their success)<br>, Competitor Benchmarking (surface opportunities for improvement),
                       UX principles Benchmarking (evaluates website/product against principles),<br> UX checklists and Heuristics 
                       (Analyse and evaluates on how to improve design), UX Trends and Evaluation<br> (Identifies new direction in the field of UX), 
                       Technical Analysis (check for constraints and limitations), Process Analytics<br> (understanding how the system works). 
              </p1>
              <br>

               
            <p1>The question could be why is UI and UX important in design? well it is important that the design of the product makes
                 sense to users, it should meet<br> the user’s needs, they must be able to use that product, use simple language and design
                  with accessibility. <br>There are several benefits of these designs such as improving user’s acquisition, Keeping the
                   user’s on using the product,<br> effective product and well designed with no bugs, Increase in productivity and lastly
                    more user engagement. UX<br> on its own is useful in creating products of value, increase trust leading to increase in
                     profit,<br> and help in reduction of long-term costs (reduction in customer support and errors). References </p1> <br>
