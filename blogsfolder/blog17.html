            <p> <h1>My experience taking the Implicit Bias Tests and how Implicit Bias impacts software development.:Reflection  </h1>
                <p> June 26, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>
<br>
              <p1>Study shows that Implicit Bias Test is when we have unconscious attitudes or stereotypes towards a group of people, 
                  on the other hand the word implicit means indirect, This test <br>has an impact on our understanding, choices and actions. 
                  Bias could mean good, bad or neutral, you can make bias choices depending on your psychological preferences like when<br> 
                  taking Implicit Association Test and you may come as being racist, but how does the test decide you are racist from
                   unconscious decisions? This question will answer whether the <br>Implicit Bias Test is even necessary while including my 
                   view on taking this test. Findings also show that our biases could be hidden, this is also seen<br> from word association
                    test which prove we can read misspelled paragraphs, fill in words based on<br> our memory and beliefs that what are implying
                     is correct. 
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>
                From the test I took, it was 15 minutes and I had to associate words and images with good or bad by pressing the key on
                 keyboard, “I” for good and “e” for bad word and if you are wrong, <br>it will display a cross but if you are correct it moves
                  to the next selection. Being too slow might result in being bias that you have to think about the answer, so you have to<br>
                   quick while making your choices. At some point there were images of white and black people that had to be associated with 
                   good or bad and the answers are supposed to be your pure preferences<br> form unconscious mind then the test can determine
                    whether or not you are racist. According to me it is not all the time that these psychological tests, actually prove<br>
                     that a person is bias without being aware, our actions and attitudes towards other people, the kind of treatment we
                      possess towards different people identify<br> if we are being bias or not however considering that we are discussing about<br>
                       being “implicitly bias” it is indeed different.<br>  </p1>
                 
                    

                      <p1>
                        A psychologist stated that “findings from the tests suggest that implicit bias outcomes are possible, but they do not 
                        translate into behaviour or explicit bias”. Other findings also show<br> that this approach on changing certain behaviours is
                         misguided because it could later just result in wasting or harmful policy however scientist who created this test believe<br> 
                         it will change the world for the better. One thing that I question is that you can take the test and once you know how the
                          test works you will probably get the best score, so that would<br> not mean implicit bias test since you have a memory of the
                           questions and how to respond right? I do not completely believe these tests<br> can predict a person’s behaviour, that is probably<br>
                            the reason behind the term implicit. 
                      </p1>
                      
                      <br>
                <p1>Good or bad implicit bias ahs an impact on software development, even academic achievements but how? Well already software 
                    fields take account of explicit bias but not implicit bias,<br> certain roles can be associated to women and others to men,
                     already men are considered to be IT experts that we see less women in that field. Those in high levels show less integrity,<br>
                      you will also notice that in high levels of software development there will be mostly white people and less blacks. 
                      The division and being bias in software development result in less<br> females choosing that route while they are capable
                       of the work and less black people because of assumptions that they<br> are not as good in software related jobs.     </p1>
