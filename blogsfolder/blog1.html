            <p> <h1>Scientific research and development</h1>
                <p> March 21, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>Science is the most prodigious channel of knowledge 
              and has a great impact on humanity. The development 
              of science<br> started back in the centuries where Scientists 
              would take their  time to come up with solutions to 
              create an advanced living<br> as it is now, we now live in a 
              world of technology because of the scientific research 
          
              Recording, storing and communication<br> is made to be 
              effective using phones and cameras. This progression
              involves studies that we now call engineering and 
              science.<br> The process might have been slow then but now 
              that we have more access to resources, many 
              researchers and developers <br>are involved to release more 
              advanced products or technology items.</p1>
<br>
<br>
               <h3>Looking into photography and film making, the use of cameras</h3>
               <br>
              <p1>The first camera was invented in 1888 by George Eastman and he named it “Kodak”. Studies show that 
                cameras are made of cover<br> which has  a compound containing glass fibre, therefore this indeed proves 
                that manufacturing of cameras involves more of scientific<br> research including calculations and that is 
                “Mathematics”. Back then a camera was considered a big machine which no one could<br> always carry 
                around but due to the progression in research and work in the creation  of cameras they’ve created 
                portable<br> items we take around and use in taking pictures later storing data and keeping the records. </p1><br>

                <p1>Long hours and months in construction of this machines with interchangeable parts brought us not only 
               affordable items but reliable products<br> that are effective. I mean look at how small a camera is now but it 
               does a lot of work, stores a lot memories and it is even creating opportunities<br> of jobs but mostly we don’t 
               think of the processin making this cameras nor  how it works therefore looking into this research brings a<br> 
              lot of understanding in development of the world we are living in. Today we make stories and writings by 
              using photography, <br>the movies or stories that we watch were created by these cameras in the production 
              of film making which is now a course being studied<br> in universities, with just one click on the button, the 
              lenses are on focus to take pictures or record, and this is great work of knowledge<br>. The research in the 
              creation of cameras continues as it must to manufacture much better cameras, faster and with better 
              lenses.</p1>
<br>
<br>
               <h3>continuation of scientific research and other devices manufactured</h3>
               <br>
            <p1>On the positive side the studies must continue, looking at devices we use in everyday life scientific 
              research had and still has great  impact in creating<br> better and less stressful lives especially as the 
              population continues to grow, for an instant creation of devices or machines in health facilities<br> that make 
              job easier and faster. The problem is the misuse of technology and science for one person’s benefit that<br>
              affects a lot of people in negative way but looking at more benefits to humanity the development must 
              continue.</p1> <br>
