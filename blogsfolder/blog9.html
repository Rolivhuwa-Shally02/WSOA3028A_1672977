            <p> <h1>study of information geographies</h1>
                <p> March 28, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>
<br>
                
  
                <p1>To understand the meaning of information geographies and its importance, we must first get an insight of what
                   geography is, it is not just a subject after<br> all right? But there is more into it. Geography is the study of
                    the earth’s physical features, atmosphere, spatial and geographic<br> data and how humans interact with that 
                    information. It also includes interaction and distribution of the population in the<br> specific region with the 
                    resources, economic and political activities. Information geographies is basically about the<br> knowledge of where 
                    something is, what is provided in the place, this can be presented in a form a map<br> with grids, lines, points and
                     areas showing real life features in a specific area for instance <br>Johannesburg mining site and how much gold is
                      available using polygons (areas).</p1>
  <br>
                
                <p1>The study of information geography shows that “information has always had geography”, information changes
                   as time and space change, it is mostly moderated by technology<br> and this is because we live in a world of technology,
                    technology keeps on growing or improving while this growth is not the same<br> in every region of the world, 
                    some countries are not technologically developed as much therefore information will not be<br> transferred 
                    around effectively. Another way of referring information is through infrastructures and networks. <br>
                    There are also (im)mutable augments on how information about places is essential because it affects
                     accessibility and <br>understanding of different places of the world which in my opinion it is true,
                      if a company or you as <br>an individual what to find information about a certain area for business 
                      or travelling purposes,<br> getting access of data on the search about the place is important. 
                  </p1><br>
<br>
                  <h3>Relation between Geographies access, enablement and participation</h3>
  <br>
                  <p1>
                    As a result of technology and services distribution, we get accessibility to transmission of information, 
                    participation of the people in that area and representation <br>of data. This is more about engagement and 
                    accessibility, how often do people in that area use internet, <br>do they have internet connection, Is there 
                    availability of devices to use different software applications<br> or technology tools, what about 
                    affordability? African countries do not have access to some technology <br>tools that are in china, therefore 
                    the use of these software tools will not be the same in each region<br> of the earth, participation is based on 
                    access and enablement.
               </p1>
               <br>
               <h3> Reflection on study geographies</h3>
                 <br>
              <p1>
                This study shows the reason behind the uneven geographies of different spaces on earth is that lack of participation
                 and representation rate just keep on increasing,<br> there is not much evidence showing that world’s information geographies
                  is improving, Transmission of information and<br> improvement on technology and mobility expands more in urban areas. As the
                   environment transforms, information also changes <br>and these changes are industrial
