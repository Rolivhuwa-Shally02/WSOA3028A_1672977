            <p> <h1>Critical analysis of my UX and UI: My Website</h1>
                <p> june 04, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>
<br>
              <p1>Through readings and what I have learnt during lectures, UX and UI design are the foundation of content development.
                   I will be discussing and giving an insight of what<br> I have done on my site, the design pattern and the reasons for
                    them as well as what I do not see fit or bad <br>design ideas on my website and furthermore what I would want to
                     correct that like part of bad design pattern<br> and for later improvements. 
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>As part of my webstyle I decided to use colour codes that are not so into your face, the choice of my colours came
                   from strawberries and blueberries, weird right? <br>But because my website is about food and my character loves those
                    fruits, I made a choice to give my website a shade of<br> those colours. What I would want to change is the home page 
                    picture, and rather have berries that match up with my choice<br> of colours instead of lemons, however the flower in 
                    the background symbolises sanity and lemons for health while food is also <br>for health therefore that is the reason 
                    behind the homepage design. For more navigation through the website,<br> there is a hovering button in the middle of 
                    the homepage picture for more food ideas, I made this to be responsive<br> as part of user interface, users being able 
                    to interact with items on the website.  </p1>
                    <br>

                      <p1>
                        The header has the navigation menu and two dropdown menus now (Theory blogs  and Creative Work),<br> in the previously it was one drop-down menu, cause then i had
                         chosen to do something different for the users by using<br> buttons within another page to navigate to other
                          3 pages with fall under that one page where the buttons are located.<br> User experience will depend on the 
                          users find the design to be however my idea was made to interest those who will use the sight.<br> The drop-down
                           menus shares one of colour in shading of the footer and the header, this is so that use of <br>
                           colours correspond or match even on different pages.  The header has a logo and brand next to each other,
                            the logo was made <br>to be small because already there is a brand name otherwise it was going to be too much<br>
                             and might cause bad design layout.    

                      </p1>
                    
                      <br>
                <p1>The theory blog page has sections of columns, with picture next to each blog content space however the blogs 
                    navigate to their respective pages using “read more” link. <br>This was done so that the blogs are accessible also
                     on their own page there are at their own space and readable,<br> this made a great layout for information is clear
                      and well conveyed. The theory blogs page with these columns can however <br>be improved for spaces in between are
                       not therefore this interferes with the layout. The wireframes<br> are simple, easy to read although, there don not 
                       offer much information yet while this I being modified to set clarity on high<br> level to the users. The choice on
                        footer colour was so it matches with the header, the are contacts icons and information,<br> cell number, location
                         and email then just below for more contact information social icons <br>are used which are responsive when hovering
                          they transform size, this part of design is to delight the users,<br> part of great experience.    </p1>
