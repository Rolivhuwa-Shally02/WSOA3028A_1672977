            <p> <h1>Development of technology and Websites</h1>
              <p>March 28, 2021 by Mandaha RS</p>
              <section>
                <br>
             <p1>We are living in a world of technology categorised into construction, transportation, energy, 
              manufacturing, <br> bio-related and communication. This all brought into action by knowledge, 
              theoretical and practical work of a man.<br>Technology also led to the development of websites that 
              we are using now as a form of searching information and creating<br> site of learning, exploring and 
              for entertainment. Findings show that the first website was created in 1989 by a British<br> scientist 
              called Tim Berners-Lee who invented the World Wide Web then it was published in 1991. In this 
              current<br> year we have large number of websites that are in use and other websites are still being 
              created. We have seven top visited<br> websites namely Youtube.com, Fcebook.com, Wikipedia, 
              Twitter, Amazon, play.google.com and lastly Instagram. </p1> <br>

              <p1>Websites are very useful and important in our daily lives and we spend more of time on the 
                internet especially now during the pandemic.<br>We learn online thus we do more searches than 
                relying on lecture notes or just textbooks. People advertise their businesses<br> or search for jobs on 
                internet sites and that makes life easier considering that finding jobs or putting your work out<br>
                there for people to see and purchase would be harder if one had to travel to places and showcase 
                or seek jobs. </p1>
<br>
                <h3>Misuse of technology and Cybercrime</h3>
<br>
                <p1>Technology offers a lot of services that end up causing addiction and abuse of the devices and its
                  services, People end up using the internet <br>too much often, always on the phone or looking at the 
                  computer screen more hours than they normally should which is not healthy.<br> Another thing is 
                  when user’s personal information gets exposed which puts their lives at risk and this is due to
                  software failure from the development<br>  site. An example would be from 2018 standard security 
                  issue by Google+ and Facebook where too many people’s personal information<br> was exposed. 
                  Cyberbullying is also a big problem that even causes loss of lives and this is all misuse of 
                  technology.
                  <br>
                  <h3>Using technology and websites to improve our lives</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p1>As it should be technology started with the whole purpose of improving people’s lives and 
                    growing our world’s economy. <br>We should make use of the opportunity to grow our lives, 
                    develop, make money and create opportunities for others too.</p1> <br>
