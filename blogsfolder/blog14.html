                <p> June 09, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>In April 2018, a well-known social network made headlines when it was discovered that private information of
                   users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica for advertisement<br>purposes during United States election in 2016.
                    Cambridge Analytica is British political data-analysis firm that <br>is no longer in action. Facebook disclosed
                     about 87 million users’ data without their knowledge and this was reported<br> to be a security breach tied to
                      Cambridge Analytica following Trump’s 2016 elections.<br> Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg<br>
                       admitted to the reports however he was not  
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>aware of such and apologised for not protecting users’ information as he should have. Further investigations were
                   done and later in September Facebook admitted to have <br>leaked 50 million users’ data to cybercriminals and they 
                   later on revealed that it was due to a security bug which <br>allowed access to 6.8 million users’ profiles. People’s
                    information was accessed by hackers, no one knows what they could<br> do with so much information about a person
                     and that puts people lives at risk. More information and ethical<br> issues such as weak cyber security, honesty,
                      reliability etc will be discussed in the report.  </p1><br>



                      <p1>
                        Furthermore, later in September 2018, Facebook announced the existence of a security bug that allowed access 
                        to cybercriminals in obtaining data of 50 million users<br> and after that in December they revealed that the 
                        security failure allowed unauthorised access to profiles of<br> 6.8 million users. Following the breakout news
                         more information was released, Cambridge Analytica suspended the <br>CEO of the company and Mark Zuckerberg
                          published a post apologizing to their involvement in Facebook data<br> breach and not protecting users against 
                          the abuse of personal information. Facebook was given a 5<br> billion penalty by FTC (Federal Trade Commission)
                           for violating users’ privacy. 

                      </p1>
                      
                      <br>
                <p1>The social platform’s vice president Ime Archibong stated that they are working on making changes by fixing the
                     product’s failures and building new higher standards<br>products under the requirements given out by the FTC. 
                     The requirements included that Facebook must block third-party<br> applications. However there were speculations 
                     that the information that was harvested was still in use for electoral<br> purposes in 2020 but Donald Trump still
                      did not win the elections and that relived people, for this is not the<br>only case where data is being harvested, 
                      have control of which application wants to capture your personal data<br> where possible, do not just accept cookies
                       or using your google account<br> to sign in every application.    </p1>
