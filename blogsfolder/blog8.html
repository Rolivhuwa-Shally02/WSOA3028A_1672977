            <p> <h1>Usability and accessibility on the web</h1>
                <p> May 21, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>First, we must understand the difference between usability and accessibility in order to discuss this
                 concept. Usability measures how much or <br>often the system is used, this could the software or an application
                  etc. it also has to do with efficiency, quality <br>and satisfaction when using something. Accessibility is 
                  more of being able to navigate on and access the materials of the system.<br> Now we are discussing this relating
                   to World Wide Web (WWW aor the Web). The Web is a computer system which links<br> information, that is where we
                    go to access information on the search engine, when we talk<br> of internet, websites et. That has to do with the web.</p1>

              <br>
              <p1> Users visit Web applications, and return to previous pages they had accessed 
                if people can easily find useful information, organised in a way <br>
                that facilitates access and navigation, and presented according to a well-
                structured layout. In other words, the acceptability <br>of Web applications by 
                users relies strictly on the applications’ usability - Maristella Matera
                
                Usability is one relevant factor of a Web application’s quality. Recently, <br>
                it has received great attention, and been recognised as a fundamental prop-
                erty for the success of Web applications.<br>
                </p1><br>

                <p1>Defining methods for ensuring 
                  usability is therefore one of the current goals of Web engineering research. 
                  Also, much attention is currently paid to usability by industry, which is<br> 
                  recognising the importance of adopting usability methods during the de-
                  velopment process, to verify the usability of Web applications.<br> Usability is about human behavior.
                  It recognizes that humans are lazy, get emotional, are not interested in putting a lot of effort into,<br>
                   say, getting a credit card and generally prefer things that are easy to do vs. those that are hard to do.<br>
                  
             </p1>
              <br>
               
            <p1>
              Now let’s focus on accessibility on the web, People should be able to access information or content on your website, 
              that is like an example on what usability is in the web,<br> another example would be pricings of your products, are people able to purchase that product?
              Accessibility guidelines consist of many requirements that guide designers<br> and developers to create accessible content
               for a wider audience. These guidelines are some standards meeting the needs of different users globally.<br>
              Web content is defined as the images, sounds, and texts that are being used. Each one of them is related to a 
              sense of human bodies, like sight or hearing, which helps<br>users to consume different content on the web. Usability 
              and accessibility might not be same but the work together to make<br> a software system, computer systems and  products 
              effective
