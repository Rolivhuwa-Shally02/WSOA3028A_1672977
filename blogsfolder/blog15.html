            <p> <h1>Making a feminist internet in Africa: why the internet needs African feminists and feminism :Reflection  </h1>
                <p> June 13, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>I would first like to give an overview of feminism then I will later give a discussion of my perspective on 
                  this context. Feminism can be the advocacy of women’s<br> rights concerning equality of gender or it could mean 
                  the political, economic and social equality of gender. Feminism<br> is shaped by the issues faced across the nation, 
                  the struggles because of race and gender inequality even here in Africa.<br> gatherings were conducted in April 2014 
                  to explore internet feminism, Pointing out changes in feminist analysis<br> and the purpose of internet and technology
                   in our daily lives.
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>The research shows that there have been changes in years 2015 and 2019, there has been an increase in internet
                   users by a rate of 15 million with social media being the<br> highest influencer of the change, I would not disagree
                    on this because through technology devices we have been<br> stimulated to let our voices out in social media, to
                     communicate through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube <br>and other social platforms, there are many feminists
                      making their voice to be heard and addressing struggles we face as women <br>and more as black females through social
                       media because that is where most people spend their days on, on their<br> devices, that is where we access information looking at how times are changing.   </p1><br>



                      <p1>
                        Africa as whole does not have more access to the internet, technology devices that are modified and connectivity
                         so that is a matter of inequality of access to and<br> representation on the internet, Well Africa has resources of
                          materials wanted by more developed countries thus they will use this<br> region for experiments, testing drugs
                          \ illegally and this is because there do not have a voice over social<br> media to address the issues or expose
                           these acts, sometimes it’s because the regions are poor<br> and they even lack information about things. 
                      </p1>
                      
                      <br>
                <p1>The use of internet contributed to growing and making Feminists in Africa, connecting them and using the power 
                    of internet to address more issues we face based on inequality. <br>These gatherings and meetings can take over the
                     internet and social media if indeed they are meant to build and not divide,<br> there is no form of violent conveyed 
                     in any way so for that if the change will uplift and empower women<br> in Africa the indeed more voices are needed 
                     to push economic, social, cultural and political<br> aspects to better standard.     </p1>
