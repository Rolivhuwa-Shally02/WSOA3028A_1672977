            <p> <h1>Digital Divide  </h1>
                <p> May 20, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>Digital divide is the inequality between those who benefit and those who do not digitally, that
                   means access to technology and software tools.<br> The gap between developed regions and non- developed regions,
                    poor and rich people. It also has to do with<br> economic and social inequality. The nature of divide is considered
                     in terms of digital devices and subscriptions.<br> People from rural areas and those have no money or education 
                     cannot have access to more communication <br>through devices and thus they tend to lack information about what is
                      happening globally or even know or understand <br>about digital divide. There are three factors which affect digital
                     divide namely, information accessibility, <br>information utilisation and information receptiveness. 
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>Looking back into being educated and aware of how to use technology devices, this plays a role in accessing
                   information because one needs to know how to use<br> the internet, the web and all other software applications.
                    Connectivity also falls under accessibility, having <br>access to the internet at home, schools, workplace and
                     other locations is important. Levels of connectivity<br> varies in different areas, the connectivity in the
                      villages will not be proper like in the cities, this is <br>something that I have noticed myself, apart from 
                      facing internet disruption due to load shedding, internet <br>connection in the rural areas can be very poor.  </p1><br>



                      <p1>
                        The inequality might be due to demographic and socio-economic characteristics; income, level of education, 
                        gender, race, areas of living, skills that one has, political,<br> cultural and economic aspects. Research has 
                        shown that people living in urban areas have more access, then<br> when it comes to digital and IT information,
                         males know more on that and mostly employed in that industry. <br>Cultural factor limits people based on their 
                         class or status, education level and background from producing content,<br> like in YouTube, Facebook, Instagram 
                         and most times is because people do no have items and materials for such. 
<br>
                      </p1>
                      <br>
                      <h3>  How to compensate Digital divide   </h3>
                      <br>
                <p1>The main question of how to address the digital divide is closely related with the question of what 
                    specific benefit is expected with ICTs. Only with the<br> answer to this question in mind can the digital
                     divide meaningfully be bridged in a way that leads to real-world positive impact.<br> A person must be able to 
                     connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and cultural capital as well as achieve mass economic gains<br>
                      in productivity. Accessibility is a necessary condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets 
                      significant challenges that stem from income <br>restrictions. Follow up on what is happening in the country, 
                      economically, politically and other important aspects that <br>keep you alert of essential information. Get
                       technical help on how to use technology tools, how they<br> can benefit you in the working industry as well as 
                       education wise or salary wise.   </p1>
