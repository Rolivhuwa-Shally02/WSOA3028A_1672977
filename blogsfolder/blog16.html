            <p> <h1>Radical AI Podcast: Love, Challenge and Hope: Building a Movement to Dismantle the New Jim Code :Reflection  </h1>
                <p> June 20, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>

              <p1>This is a review on an interview about ethical issues, racism, discrimination integrating with technology, asking questions
                   such as, Is the AI racist, is technology racist?  Also involving<br> a research on how racism is emended in technology system
                    that led to writing of a book by Dr Ruha Benjamin called Race After Technology which addressed<br> and discussed this issue,
                     we first need to understand this concept of racism, which means discriminating or an act of treating a group people<br>
                      unequally because of race, colour or ethnic group. For a product or system to be racist we must ask ourselves if it
                       means any harm to people, was it intentional because <br>not everything that seem racist was indeed made to be racist. 
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>Dr Benjamin investigated other issues as dimensions of science, medicine and technology while focusing on relationship
                   between innovation, inequality, health justice, knowledge <br>and power which all affect the society as a whole and growth. 
                   She gave her view of race being a technology itself by stratifying social injustice in the architecture, analysing this<br>
                    will make one question the technologies that are being sold and the ones we make ourselves, whether every individual
                     form any race of any colour can use those specific tools.<br> My view is that addressing this, is only important if laws,
                      policies, industries, fields consider racism as important to the society, we also need to know what to do as an<br>
                      individual in the fields we work in, our practices and products we develop that they don’t appear as supporting 
                      racism furthermore products, technology tools being sold<br> should account for all races, its not about making something 
                      that will “wow” consumers but it should consider local, <br>national organisation pushing at the policy level. 
                  </p1>

<br>
                      <p1>Some policies for workers were not reviewed thoroughly for black workers that later these workers get affected,
                           for an example some policies made are affecting workers<br> during the pandemic all because of technology associated
                            systems, In hospitals there are machines that now sort pills, they offer food to patients, or other machines for<br>
                             certain purposes and later we find that they affect communication, black people having power and we mostly fear
                              black people losing jobs because mostly that’s the case and<br>already they would be struggling financially. 
                              Another example is having drug penalty higher for black people but lower for white people as this was addressed<br> 
                              by Dr Ruha. Some technology tools are made to work better on particular skin colour, like form of a research 
                              conducted on laser treatment causing many issues on people<br> with dark skin meanwhile the effects on white skin
                               were not really identified but only common side effects, the reason<br> could be that the manufacturer is of white
                                colour and this treatment was<br> not tested on a person with dark skin. 
                        </p1>
                      
                      <br>
                <p1>I certainly agree that sometimes an approach to technology for solutions is not necessary, if the change benefits people 
                    of a particular race and not the other then that is racism,<br>if certain products are made available to everyone but not
                     meant for every race that plays a role in racism. Another simple example of<br>an incident of hair products that were being
                      sold at Clicks store which were not considering natural black hair but they were made available for everyone so that<br>
                       is another issue of racism, point is if you are selling an item, or product out there to everyone then that product/item 
                       should be usable by everybody, the benefit should be<br> on the seller and both ethnic groups. It is also said that love plays a role,
                        if you have love for all people, of all colour or race, indeed your energy and your skills will<br> be used not to harm but to
                         better the lives of the communities. We must also use our voice to make a change, identify and address what needs to be changed<br>
                          in technology tools that are racist, what needs to be changed in workplace, faculty of study, <br>field of study/work  must be
                           addressed loudly to bring a change.     </p1>
