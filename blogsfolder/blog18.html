            <p> <h1>The use of Web APIs  </h1>
                <p> June 30, 2021 by Mandaha RS </p><br>
              <section>
                  <br>

              <p1>To understand what Web API is, let’s first look into the definition of API itself, API stands for Application
                   Programming Interface, it is the code that governs the access<br> points for the server, it provides data so that
                    you can view or use an application. Proper and good APIs make it easier to <br>develop a computer program by providing 
                    all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. Another<br> definition which can make things
                     understandable is that Application Programming Interfaces are<br> constructs made available in programming languages
                      to allow developers to create complex functionality more<br> easily. What they do is that they abstract more complex
                       code away from you, giving back easier syntax that you<br> can understand and make use of.  
              </p1>

               <br>
              <p1>
                Here is an example from MDN Web Docs-electricity supply in your house, apartment, or other dwellings. 
                If you want to use an appliance, you will plug it into a plug socket and it does<br>work right? you would 
                not have to try and wire it directly into the power supply — to that would not be efficient and, if you<br>
                 are not an electrician or do not know your ways around operation of electric appliances, it is difficult 
                 and dangerous to attempt. Now from that example you will be able to analyse<br> and understand why we use Web API
                  and why they are necessary for your Websites and Applications. I mean if you can get google APIs to your site<br>
                   without having to create yours is very convenient, yes you have add more codes depending on how you want they
                    API to look on your website. 
                  </p1>
                 
                    
<br>
                      <p1>
                        As we move deeper to why Web APIs are necessary, why we use them and different approaches that I know, we will
                         also get know what APIs can do basically, their use and <br>importance. The browser APIs can be used to manipulate
                          documents, the DOM API allows the manipulation of HTML and CSS, you can create, remove<br> and change HTML, apply
                           your styling to get the layout you prefer. APIs are used to fetch data from server like what I used, while also<br>
                            following a lecture form class. We used fetch to get data from a server. Where I used Rapidapi.com site to 
                            check for APIs that were accessible/free and then use my provided<br> unique API key. Fetch is used on small detail
                             parts of the page, you can use the Fetch API to get more functions of the same API <br>and even add few more APIs
                              to your website. You can integrate this with JavaScript, HTML and your CSS. Web APIs are also important when<br>
                               you want to add video APIs, playing Audio, displaying tracks and you can also manipulate this to operate
                                the way you would prefer. They can also be useful <br>when you want to store information on the client side,
                                 like making the app to show some data even when you are offline.
                      </p1>
                      
                      <br>
                <p1>  I also the importance of Web APIs when I had planned to create my own food search Application, while with Web API you
                     can look in the internet for already made APIs, either free,<br> freemium, or prepaid so you can select what you prefer and
                      fetch that to your website and manipulate it, add codes, style the layout. It is efficient<br> and effective especially if 
                      that API is accessible at all times for the users. I used COVID-19 statistics API from Rapidapi.com, I chose this API<br>
                       because it is relevant to health and what is happening world wide as we are still in pandemic with a rise in Covid cases,
                        I believe that people will like to know about that <br>information but most importantly it adds to my website content, I wanted more
                         interaction in my site and on the about<br> page, reason I put the Web API there. Users are able to check the statistics of every country, 
                         I fetched data for new confirmed cases, total<br> confirmed cases, new deaths, total deaths and last updated (which basically shows the
                          current date).   </p1>
