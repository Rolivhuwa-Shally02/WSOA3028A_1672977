            <p> <h1>Google plus and Facebook security failure leading to user’s data getting exposed                         
              </h1> <h3>CYBERCRIME</h3>
               
              <p>April 15, 2021 by Mandaha RS</p>

             <p1>We live in a world of technology where the internet provides us 
               with so many advantages in this modern world, we google information <br> and put information there,
                we have access to job advertisements, creation of websites and visiting other websites and there are Social<br> 
                platforms for communication and entertainment. Facebook and Google are technology companies that provide social networks,<br>
                while the internet brings so many good things it also creates problems for the user’s in terms of privacy and security. 
                Following the news<br> that made headlines in 2018 where Google+ discovered a security bug in March 2018 but revealed to the 
                consumers in October 2018 and this<br> affected 52.5 million users. Although Google company mentioned that the financial and 
                passwords information is not to be accessed by the<br> third-party applications there is still a risk of other developers 
                getting access through google “sign in” we do on those other applications.<br> People’s lives were put to risk because Google+
                 apps has access to their users’ information through<br> the API. Some of the ethical issues involved in this software failure 
                 will be discussed as we proceed. </p1> <br>

              <p1>In April 2018, another social network made headlines when it was discovered that private information of users was 
                accessed by Cambridge<br> Analytica for advertisement purposes during United States election in 2016. Cambridge Analytica
                 is British political data-analysis<br> firm that is no longer in action. Facebook disclosed about 87 million users’ data
                  without their knowledge and this was<br> reported to be a security breach tied to Cambridge Analytica following Trump’s 2016 elections.
                   Facebook Inc. <br>Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg admitted to the reports however he was not aware of such and apologised for<br>
                    not protecting users’ information as he should have.  <br>
             <br>
             <p1>
              The two social platforms discussed above are used in our daily lives and aim to bring a lot advantages in this modern world 
              and improve people’s lives<br> and  therefore they should bring forward their consumer’s need and protect their private information.
               The other issues we end up<br> questioning is who is benefiting from the leaked society’s private information and we end up no getting
                answers which shows no <br>respect to people’s confidential and privacy, later this can bring harm to people for they will no longer
                 be safe from cybercriminals <br>or even stalkers.  For future work developers need to address security during development not after 
                 releasing their products, they need<br> to maintain their security standards. They must give assurance by actions taken to users that
                  if information in encrypted I should be hard to have<br> access to private information and also that if sensitive information is not
                   to be<br> accessed by third-party developers then they should deny them access. 
              </p1> <br>
              <br>
<p1>Both social networks admitted to the software failures and took responsibility of their involvement leakage of users’ personal data,<br>
   both in process of implementing new features with higher standard security and maintaining the current applications that had faults.<br>
    Although it is difficult for people to trust both Google and Facebook, investigation show that they are following requirements to <br>
    gain users trust back and in improvements done it shows that ethics are being practiced accordingly but this does not guarantee <br>
    they will not be any other Software failures however we hope for better improvements in security<br> by the technical companies and the developers.  </p1> <br>
