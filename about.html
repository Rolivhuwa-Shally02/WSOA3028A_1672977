                  <h1>    Get to know me</h1>

                  <p1>
Hi there lovies! I am Noxolo Faith Mphephu, 28 years of age and I'm from 
 Johannesburg Protea glen,<br>I was born in Venda, you might have been wondering gazing at my last name,
  My father is Venda all the way from the villages<br> who met his Zulu queen in the City Of Gold and thereafter i was born,
   a first born in a family of 3 girls and one boy child <br> I am currently residing in Sandton due to my current job position in SAICA as a mentor and
    from being one of the top 50 newly Charted Accountants in SA. <br> I am also a fitness bunny, well atleast i think i am and keeping up with a great work on it,
     building my social patforms as a fitness trainer is a result of that,<br> Seeing people engaging in a healthy life style always puts a smile on my face and hope that
     there are people out there who believe that taking care<br> of ones health is a necessity so join me as we sweat up!, get fit! and maintain with the right kind of food.
    
     <br>
     
     
    
    
<p1>This is what you must start with "food for thought" inspired by Fulufhelo Siphuma</p1>  
<br>
<img src="images/images.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="food">
<br>
 <br>"Healthy does not look a certain way"<br>
"Healthy is not a particular body type"<br> 
"Healthy looks different on everybody"<br>

 

                  </p1> 
                  <br>
     <h1> I will be showing you how to stay healthy, fit and take care of your sanity</h1> 

     <p> Staying healthy should not be expensive to start with, you do not have to buy expensive food to be
       healthy, you do not have to pay up for gym to workout,<br> I mean i wake in the morning and work out in my room, with no weights but just
      me and my own body with a bottle of water, this is all part <br>of healthy lifestyle and this includes your sanity, having peace of mind, feeling relaxed
    and releasing that tension in your body. Some people prefer meditation<br> and that also works so go to a nice area, clean and environmentally user-friendly
  you can do this with music or no music, sometimes when you are outdoors <br>surrounded by nature, that also helps with relaxation and clearing mind </p>
      <br>
      <h1> Easy daily routine: Drink water on a daily basis</h1> 
      <img src="images/woman-drinking-water-260nw-135130826.jpg" style="width: 20%;" alt="food">
      <br> 
      
    <h1> healthy diet and cheat days</h1>
    <p> Do not eat the same meal everday continously, change your diet, Most people are used to the same meal, sometimes we are lazy to make 
      a different meal, sometimes we just donâ€™t have variety<br> of ingredients, well i can relate to all, try to change your meals and not get
    used to the same routines, eating healthy does not mean you nolonger<br> going to eat chocolate or cookies, it is nice to have some snacks once in a while
  but do not make this regularly, sugary and sweet food are nice but if you <br>want be healthy just have those "cheat days". Do not eat 
the same type of fruit many times a day, vary your fruits, for<br> instance if you have two bananas and two apples, take one from each type of fruit</p>
